                                    data analysis in case of an in-flight anomaly. The telemetry unit also waits for an optimal velocity and altitude to deploy the recovery system. The software running on the
                                    control unit uses state-detection to ensure that it is performing the correct actions at the correct points in flight.

                                    separate it from the main vehicle, releasing the parachute.
